    - Land, Building, Equipment

    - Accounts Payable, Short-term Loans
- Non-current Liabilities: Due after a year
    - Long-term Loans, Bonds 
- Shareholder's Equity: Assets - Liabilities
    - Common Stock, Retained Earnings


!!! Important
    Balance sheet should always be balanced. Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder's Equity

??? Question "Which one was Debit and Which one was Credit?"
    - Debit: Left side of the account (when you get money)
    - Credit: Right side of the account (when you pay money)

If we were to use credit to buy inventory at 60, and sell it at 90, the balance sheet would look like this:

<div class="grid" markdown>

| Assets  <img width=300/> | |
| ------ | - |
| Cash  | 47 |
| Inventory | 0 |
| Accounts Receivable | 90 |
| Equipment | 80 |
| ^^Total Assets^^ | 217 |

| Liabilities  <img width=300/> | |
| ------ | - |
| Current Liabilities   | 60 |
| Non-current Liabilities   | 50 |
| Shareholders'Equity   | 100 |
| Revenue | 90 |
| Cost of Sales | (60) |
| Salary | (20) |
| Interest | (3) |
| ^^Total Liabilities^^ | 217 |

??? Question "Another Example"
    - Issues shares of 300
    - Bought equipment for 200
    - Bought inventory for 100, 80 of this was cash, remainder is outstanding
    - Sold 75% of inventory for 120, 100 has been received in cash
    - Paid cash expense of 15
    
    What would the balance sheet look like?

    - Issued shares of 300
    
    <div class="grid" markdown>

## Income Statement

- Revenue: Money earned from selling goods or services
- Direct Costs: Costs directly related to producing goods or services
- Indirect Costs: Costs not directly related to producing goods or services
- Gross Profit: Revenue - Direct Costs
- Operating Profit: Gross Profit - Indirect Costs
- Net Profit: Operating Profit - Tax and Interest

!!! Example 

    ABC. Inc. buys a truck for $45,000 will use it in the business for 5 years, and in 5 years expects to sell it for 
    $15,000

    - Balance Sheet - Assets : 39,000
    - Income Statement - Depreciation : 6,000
    - Cash Flow Statement - Investing Activities : 45,000

### Calculating operating cash flow - direct method

Operating cash inflow - Operating cash outflow = Net operating cash flow

This method is rarely used

### Calculating operating cash flow - indirect method

| | |
| - | - |
| Net Income | A |
| Depreciation | B |
| (Increase)/Decrease in Receivable | (C)/C |
| (Increase)/Decrease in Inventory | (D)/D |
| Increase/(Decrease) in Payable | E/(E) |
| Net Operating Cash Flow | X |


??? Example

    - Cash Purchases: 250
    - Cash Sales: 370
    - Cash expenses: 40
    - Depreciation: 55

    | Income Statement | |
    | - | - |
    | Revenue | 370 |
    |Purchases | (250) |
    | Expenses | (40) |
    | Depreciation | (55) |
    | Net Income | 25 |

    | Cash flow direct | |
    | - | - |
    | Cash Sales | 370 |
    | Cash Purchases | (250) |
    | Cash Expenses | (40) |
    | Net Operating Cash Flow | 80 |

    | Cash flow indirect | |
    | - | - |
    | Net Income | 25 |
    | Depreciation | 55 |
    | Increase in Receivable | 80   |

??? Example

    - Cash Purchases: 280
    - Cash sales: 300
    - Sales on Credit: 170
    - Cash expenses: 50
    - Receipts on receivables: 140
    - Depreciation: 55

    | Income Statement | | 
    | - | - |
    | Revenue | 300 + 170 |
    | Purchases | (280) | 
    | Expenses | (50) |
    | Depreciation | (55) |
    | Net income | 85 |

    | Cash flow direct | | 
    | - | - |
    | Revenue | 300 + 140 |
    | Purchases | (280) |
    | Expenses | (50) |
    | Change in cash | 110 |
    

    | Cash flow indirect | |
    | - | - |
    | Net income | 85 |
    | Depreciation | 55 |
    | Increase in AC Receivables | 140 - 170 |
    | Change in cash | 110 |

??? Example

    - Cash purchases: 150
    - Cash sales: 320
    - Sales on credit : 310
    - Purchases on credit: 180
    - Receipts from receivables: 260
    - Payments to payables: 140
    - Cash expenses: 70
    - Depreciation: 55

    | Income Statement | |
    | - | - |
    | Sales | 320 + 310 |
    | Purchases | (150 + 180) |
    | Expenses | (70) |
    | Depreciation | (55) |
    | Net income | 175 |

    | Cash flow direct | | 
    | - | - |
    | Inflow | 320 + 260 |
    | Purchases | (150 + 140)
    | Expenses | (70) |
    | Change in cash | 220 |

    | Cash flow indirect | |
    | Net income | 175 |
    | Depreciation | 55 |
    | Account Receivables | (310 - 260 = 50) | 
    | Account Payables | 180 - 140 = 40 |
    | Change in cash | 220 |

### Deriving complete cash flow statement

It's possible to derive cash flow statements using 
- Last year's balance sheet
- This year's balance sheet
- This year's income statement

#### Stage one - Compare the balance sheets

- If assets have increased => cash outflow
- If liabilities have increased => cash inflow. 

#### Stage two - classifying the cash flow

Classify each of the cash flow statements into the following :-
- Operating cash flows
- Investing cash flows
- Financial cash flows

The cash flow we have looked at so far is operating cash flows

Difference in PP&E is occurred due to

- Depreciation lowering PP&E
- Net capital expenditure (a.k.a. CAPEX) increase PPE


$$ \text{Opening PP&E} + \text{Net CAPEX} - \text{Depreciation} = \text{Closing PP&E} $$

Difference in retained earnings is due to

- Net income (added)
- Dividends (subtracted)
